# Introduction

AlgebraOfGraphics defines a "plotting package agnostic" algebra of graphics based on a few simple building blocks that can be combined using `+` and `*`.

This package is not yet released, but can be installed typing
```julia
(@v1.4) pkg> add https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AlgebraOfGraphics.jl.git
```
in the Pkg REPL.

See [Tutorial](@ref) for examples on how to use it. Devdocs are coming up next.
