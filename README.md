Analyses rely on [StatsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsBase.jl), [Loess.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Loess.jl), [KernelDensity.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/KernelDensity.jl), and [GLM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl). Some of their documentation is transcribed here.

Visualizations are powered by [Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) and its layouting capabilities.

Automatic legend creation re-implements the machinery in [TabularMakie](https://github.com/greimel/TabularMakie.jl).
